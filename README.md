PixelPad
========

Light painting tool for Android, inspired by PixelStick.


What is it for
===============

This application displays any image to be used in light painting (a type of photography). Using the application,
a user can create a hologram-like effect for the picture.

How it works
============

The display is done by showing only one column of pixel for a very short time, then displaying the next one 
till the end of the picture.
